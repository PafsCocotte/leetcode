## Summary of Solutions

### [76. Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)
- **Strategy:** Two-pointer / Sliding Window.
- **Logic:** The **window size represents the smallest answer** found during the search.
- **Note:** Core logic is handwritten; `main` function and test cases were generated by AI (Gemini).

### [2215. Find the Difference of Two Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference-of-two-arrays/)
- **Strategy:** Hash Set / Set Difference.
- **Languages Implemented:**
    - **C++**: Used `std::unordered_set` (C++20 `contains`).
    - **Python**: Used set operators (`-`).
    - **Go**: Used `map[int]bool` to simulate a set.
    - **Rust**: Used `HashSet` and `difference()` method.
- **Key Concept:** Leveraged each language's native set operations to achieve $O(N + M)$ time complexity.
- **Note:** `main` functions for each language were generated by AI (Gemini).
